## 🏎️ Advanced Fuel Simulation: System Breakdown

This system uses a physics-based model to determine how much fuel your vehicle consumes. Instead of a simple timer, the game looks at how hard the engine is working based on your driving, the environment, and the car's condition.

### 🕹️ 1. Driving Style
How you handle the car is the biggest factor in your fuel economy.

* **Aggressive Starts:** Flooring the gas pedal from a stop "wastes" fuel because the engine dumps extra gas to get moving quickly.
* **Coasting (Gas Off):** If you let go of the gas while moving, the system cuts fuel use almost entirely because the spinning wheels keep the engine turning (Deceleration Fuel Cut Off).
* **Burnouts & Drifting:** Spinning your tires while stationary or sliding triggers a "Maximum Load" calculation, draining fuel quickly even if you aren't actually traveling anywhere.
* **Boost & Nitrous:** Using a Turbo or Nitrous oxide significantly increases the fuel required to produce that extra power.

### 🛠️ 2. Vehicle Setup & Tires
Your vehicle's physical build and parts change its "baseline" thirst.

* **Upgrades:** Better engines and turbos provide more speed but naturally burn more fuel when you push them.
* **Drivetrain (AWD vs 2WD):** All-Wheel Drive vehicles have more moving parts and suffer a fuel penalty compared to standard Rear-Wheel or Front-Wheel drive cars.
* **Tire Types:** Your choice of wheels matters significantly:
    * **Off-Road Tires:** These are the most efficient on soft ground like mud or sand, reducing the strain on the engine.
    * **Sport & Super Tires:** These are efficient on pavement but perform poorly in the dirt, forcing the engine to work much harder and waste fuel.
    * **SUV & Muscle Tires:** These provide a middle-ground balance between pavement efficiency and off-road capability.
* **Weight & Cargo:** Carrying passengers, adding heavy armor, or pulling a trailer makes the engine work harder, especially when starting or climbing hills.

### 🌍 3. The Environment
The world around you actively pushes back against your car.

* **Terrain Resistance:** Driving through mud, sand, or grass creates "drag," requiring much more gas than driving on smooth asphalt.
* **Deep Water:** Driving through deep water creates a massive drag penalty on your wheels, causing fuel to drain much faster.
* **Hill Climbing:** Driving uphill fights gravity and drains the tank faster, while driving downhill allows the engine to rest.
* **Fuel "Slosh":** Because fuel is a liquid, your gauge will move slightly if you are parked on a steep hill as the fuel shifts inside the tank toward or away from the sensor.

### 🩹 4. Damage & Maintenance
A damaged car is an inefficient car.

* **Body Damage:** If you lose your hood, doors, or bumpers, the car becomes less aerodynamic. This wind resistance forces you to use more gas to stay at speed.
* **Windows & Roofs:** Breaking a windshield or leaving the roof down on a convertible creates extra drag and hurts your fuel economy.
* **Flat Tires:** Driving on a burst tire creates massive resistance and is one of the fastest ways to waste fuel.
* **Engine Temperature:** Engines are most efficient in their middle temperature range; a very cold engine or an overheating engine will burn through the tank faster.

### ⛽ 5. Fuel Quality
Where you fill up can affect how your car runs.

* **Gas Brands:** Different gas stations provide different fuel qualities; better fuel gives you better mileage and a smoother engine.
* **Engine Misfires:** If you put very low-quality fuel in a car, the engine might "knock" or misfire, causing the car to run poorly or make audible damage noises.
* **Electric Vehicles:** The system automatically identifies electric cars and bypasses all "fuel" logic entirely.
